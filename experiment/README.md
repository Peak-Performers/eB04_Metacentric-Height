## Storyboard (Round 2)


Experiment 1: To determine the meta-centric height of a floating body.

### 1. Story Outline:

This experiment is based on the calculation of the meta-centric height of a floating body. The formula of meta-centric height requires four values i.e. Weight of the floating body(W), the weight of the load(w), the distance of the load from the center of the floating body(x), and the tilt angle(θ). The weight of the floating body and the weight of the load already have a fixed value. Users can choose the value of the distance of the load from the center of the floating body and by all these values, the tilt angle can also be calculated. <br>
The simulator will perform operations in interaction with the user, and the value of meta-centric height is obtained. 

### 2. Story:

The experiment is based on calculation of the meta-centric height of a floating body. Meta-center is defined as a point about which a body starts oscillating in the fluid when it is tilted by a small angle. Force of buoyancy is the upward force exerted by the fluid on the body. The weight of the body (force) acted along downward across the center of gravity of the body. If the body is placed in the fluid then the buoyancy force will act vertically and is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body. The distance between the meta-center of the floating body and the center of gravity of the body is called meta-centric height. The simulator is designed to calculate the meta-centric height of the body using its empirical formula. This empirical formula requires four values namely Weight of floating body(W), the weight of the load(w), a distance of the load from the center(x), and tilt angle(θ). The user chooses the distance of the load from the center by moving the slider either to the left or right side. The value of the tilt angle is calculated by these three values. The user enters the OK button to confirm the values. The user then clicks on the Start button and the simulator gets started, highlighting the executing step. A tank filled with water appears. On clicking it again, a floating body is placed in the water tank. The user then clicks the Next button a small load is placed on the floating body. On again clicking it the load displaces to a distance selected by the user. On clicking it again, the values are placed into the empirical formula. After clicking it again the user can obtain the metacentric height of a floating body. <br>
Once the metacentric height is obtained the state of the equilibrium can also be determined. The whole story design process of the simulation experiment consists of the description of the visual stage, the goals and objectives planned and the pathway set for the learner. Moreover, a few challenges and pitfalls are also set to underline and emphasize the concepts involved in the experimentation. Every stage is described thoroughly in the following subsections.

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
When the student visits the link on the simulator page, he/she sees the experiment name on the top and four blocks namely Instructions, Initialize, Step Execution and Result Visualization on the screen. The visual description of each block is mentioned below:<br>
<b>A.	Instructions block:</b> In this block the instructions for operating the simulator are mentioned.<br>
<b>B. Initialize block:</b> In this block there are two input field in which the predefined weights of the floating body and load are mentioned. There is a slider of blue color through which the user can choose the value of the position of the weight (w) of the load on the floating body. There are three buttons namely OK, Start and Next. At initial stage, only grey-coloured OK button is enabled and once the OK button is clicked both the buttons get enabled. The Start button of Bluish pink color starts the simulation and the once the start button is clicked it is replaced by the Stop button. And the user will click the bluish-pink coloured Next button until the metacentric height is calculated.<br>
<b>C.	Step Execution Block:</b> In this block all the steps of execution are mentioned. On clicking Start button the executions of the steps start. The text in the step execution block changes its color from black to red color during execution. On every click of Next button, the result in result visualization changes.<br>
<b>D.	Result Visualization block:</b> At the initial stage it is blank. On every step, the output in this block changes.    

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
The main objective of this experiment is to calculate the meta-centric height of the floating body. At the end of the module the student would be able to understand:<br>
1.	The position of buoyancy, center of gravity, and meta-center.<br>
2.	Different equilibrium conditions for the floating body.<br>
3.	Concept of the moment on the floating body if it is tilted by an angle.<br>
4.	Calculation of meta-centric height.<br>

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:
1.	Click on the Simulation tab.<br>
2.	User will scroll the slider either to right or left side to set the distance of load from center of floating body.<br>
3.	User will click on OK button of the Initialize block.<br>
4.	User will click the start button a tank filled with water appears in Result Visualization block.<br>
5.	Simulator will highlight the execution step of the Step Execution block.<br>
6.	User will click the Next button a floating body is placed in the water tank in Result Visualization block.<br>
7.	User will click the Next button again a small load is placed on the floating body.<br>
8.	User will click the Next button again the load displaces to a certain distance.<br>
9.	User will click the Next button again the floating body due to this displacement will tilt.<br>
10.	User will click the Next button again the values are placed in the formula.<br>
11.	User will click the Next button again the simulator will display the metacentric height in the result visualization block.<br>

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:
Task 1: Multiple choice questions based on LO1, LO2, LO3, and LO4.<br>
Difficulty level: Remember<br>
1. Consider the floating body, the relationship between meta-center (M) and center of gravity(G)  is: <br><b> A. M is above G </b><br> B. M is below G <br> C. M is at G <br> D. None of the above <br>
2. Metacentric height is denoted by: <br>A. GB  <br><b>B. GM</b> <br> C. GK <br> D. GB <br>
3. If the meta-center (M) and center of gravity (G) for the floating body are in the same position, then the condition is: <br>A.Stable equilibrium  <br> B.Unstable equilibrium<br><b>C. Neutral equilibrium </b> <br> D. 4.	None of the above <br>
4. The weight of the body can be calculated by using the formula: <br>A. Volume of water + Density of water  <br>B. Volume of water/ Density of water  <br><b> C. Volume of water * Density of water</b> <br> D. None of these  <br>


##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
1. If user clicked the stop button during the step execution all values will reset.<br>
2. Once the OK button is clicked, the values are fixed for the entire step executions for the calculation of metacentric height. Thus, for changing the input given by user, the page has to be refreshed.<br>
3. The value of distance of load from center of the floating body can only be given by the user through the slider.<br>


##### 2.6 Conclusion:
1.	User will take 5 minutes to understand the instructions.<br>
2.	User will take around 20 minutes to complete the experiment and to do the self-assessment.<br>
3.	At the end of the experiment, the user could able to calculate the meta-centric height of the floating body.<br>
4.	After completing the experiment user would be able to interpret different equilibrium conditions of the floating body based on experimental results of meta-centric height.<br>
5.	At the end of experiment the user will be able determine the position of buoyancy, center of gravity, and meta-center.<br>


##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA
The empirical formula for Meta-centric height (GM) is:<br>
GM = (w*Y)/(W+w)*tanθ <br>
where,<br>
W= Weight of the floating body<br>
w= Weight of load<br>
Y= Distance of load from center of the floating body <br>
θ = Tilt angle
